If you want to use the deobfuscated source code from Payne's project, I left it in this repo. But please, credit him for this cool mod! If you want the mod for regular Beta 1.7.3, check out his profile, it will be there!

By the way, this mod port was made with [PeytonPlayz's](https://github.com/PeytonPlayz595) Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 port. Check him out aswell!
